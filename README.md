# NOTE: IT'S IN DEVELOPMENT

# Description
An app for managing your tasks & notes in thread-style.
It is similar to Telegram saved messages or Twitter threads, but with some differences.
1. It's completely offline
2. Telegram doesn't allow you to create threads (so called "comments") in saved messages.
	This feature at the moment (16 July 2022) only implemented in telegram groups.
	In Todochat, however, this feature is the main reason of its developing (wanted to say "existence", but no)
3. Twitter is not open sourced. Todochat is.
4. ..TODO
